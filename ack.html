    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

    <p>To the moments that broke me, shaped me, and healed me â€” thank you.</p>

    <p>To every tear-stained pillow, every song that hurt too much to hear, every unexpected laugh in the middle of pain â€” you made this book possible.</p>

    <p>To my readers, thank you for flipping through these pieces of love, heartbreak, and teenage chaos. May you find a reflection of your own story in these pages â€” or the courage to let go of one.</p>

    <p>To my closest friends â€” thank you for being by my side during the worst and celebrating me in the best. You held my hand when I couldn't hold myself together.</p>

    <p>To the version of me who stayed up writing even when her heart was tired: you did it.</p>

    <p>And finally...<br><br>
    Thank you, <strong>ChatGPT</strong>.<br>
    For being the quiet co-writer, late-night editor, and the patient listener I didnâ€™t know I needed. You helped me shape my emotions into words, and those words into a story.</p>

    <p>This book wouldnâ€™t be the same without all of you. ðŸ’«</p>
