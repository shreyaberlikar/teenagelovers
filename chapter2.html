    <h1>Chapter 2: Prayers, Pathways, and Playful Memories</h1>

    <p>The garden was everything Aavni had promised — a little heaven wrapped in green pathways, blooming flowers, and benches hidden beneath canopies of trees. Darshan looked around, taking in the vibrant scenery, his hands gently clasped around hers.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">“You were right, this place is nice,”</span> he said with a warm smile.</p>

    <p>Aavni led him through the winding paths, her hand snugly in his. They searched for a spot that felt just right and finally settled beneath a large, shady tree — a bench made just for the two of them.</p>

    <p>Aavni gazed around, her mind drifting back to the perfect day they’d spent together…</p>

    <p>At 3 PM sharp, he had shown up at her PG, eyes lighting up as he suggested they take the temple route — setting off on an adventure neither of them would forget. On the scooty ride, she had guided him through map directions, her heart racing with excitement.</p>

    <p>He teased her, <span class="highlight">“You’re totally leading us to the wrong place, aren’t you?”</span> She laughed, shaking her head, teasing back, <span class="highlight">“You’ll see—”</span></p>

    <p>When they reached the temple, they parked the scooty and walked hand in hand toward the entrance. She could still feel the cool marble under her feet as they left their chappals at the gate, joining the line for darshan.</p>

    <p>There, in front of Bappa’s murti, surrounded by a blanket of peace, they stood together. She remembered gently putting a tilak on his forehead, sharing a moment that felt <span class="romantic">sacred and special</span>.</p>

    <p>After the darshan, they wandered outside, talking and laughing. They stumbled upon a McDonald’s and ended up with their classic burger and coffee combo, filling their booth with giggles and <span class="romantic">stolen glances</span>.</p>

    <p>She looked at him now, the memory still fresh — the laughter from that day still lingering in the air. Lost in thought, she almost didn’t hear him call her name. <span class="highlight">“Oye, Chota Hatti?”</span></p>

    <p>He lightly tapped her head, waving his hand. <span class="highlight">“You seem pretty lost there… daydreaming about me already?”</span> he teased. She blinked, coming back to the present, laughing. <span class="highlight">“Maybe I am. I was just… remembering. From the temple to here, it feels like something out of a story.”</span> (<span class="romantic">स्वप्न… like a dream.</span>)</p>

    <p>Darshan leaned in, his eyes warm. <span class="highlight">“A good one, I hope?”</span> <span class="highlight">“The best,”</span> she replied softly, squeezing his hand.</p>

    <p>They sat in silence for a moment, letting the magic of their memories settle between them — both knowing that this day, and every little piece of it, was something they’d carry with them for a long, long time.</p>

    <p>She looked into his smiling eyes and whispered, <span class="romantic">“I never thought I’d find someone like you... but now, I can’t imagine letting go.”</span></p>
