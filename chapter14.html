    <h1>Chapter 14: Between February Silence and December Doubt</h1>

    <p>Everything seemed fine from the outside ‚Äî routine phone calls, occasional texts, and those faint remnants of laughter that used to define them.</p>
    <p>But inside, something had changed.</p>
    <p>The kind of change that doesn't knock loudly or announce its arrival. It slips in quietly, <span class="highlight">between late replies and missed calls</span>, settling like dust over once-beautiful things.</p>
    <p>It was February when Darshan‚Äôs 12th board exams began. And December when Aavni‚Äôs end-semester pressure peaked.</p>
    <p>Their worlds, once tightly wound together, now drifted ‚Äî two planets slowly orbiting apart.</p>
    <p>Aavni kept justifying it in her head.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">He‚Äôs busy. It‚Äôs his boards. I shouldn‚Äôt expect so much.</span></p>
    <p>But deep inside, her heart whispered a truth her mind didn‚Äôt want to hear.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">He had changed.</span></p>
    <p>No check-ins. No questions about her day. Not even a reaction to her long texts full of love and frustration.</p>
    <p>His responses were short. Dry. Tired.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">‚ÄúBusy.‚Äù ‚ÄúSleptoff.‚Äù ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt notice your text.‚Äù</span></p>
    <p>Those weeks became months. Calls faded. Meetups nearly vanished.</p>
    <p>She started blaming herself. Maybe I‚Äôm too clingy. Maybe I‚Äôm exhausting.</p>
    <p>Even her body mirrored her pain. PCOS flares. Mood swings. Everything was heavier.</p>
    <p>Her friends noticed first.</p>
    <p>Teja: ‚Äú<span class="highlight">He doesn‚Äôt respect you, Aavni. You‚Äôre not in love ‚Äî you‚Äôre in a loop.</span>‚Äù</p>
    <p>Tani: ‚Äú<span class="highlight">You deserve more than this ‚Äòsometimes‚Äô love. You deserve always.</span>‚Äù</p>
    <p>She smiled to fake it, but inside ‚Äî she was a hollow shell sitting in the canteen, staring past laughter, lost in echoes.</p>
    <p>She looked out the window. Remembered how Darshan once waited there. Now? Nothing. Just absence ‚Äî and how <span class="highlight">effortlessly he seemed okay without her</span>.</p>
    <p>And that broke her more than any breakup could.</p>
    <p class="quote">"Because girls like Aavni‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt fall in love halfway.<br>
    They shrink themselves to fit inside someone else‚Äôs neglect."</p>
    <p>But that day, something shifted. As she watched her friends laugh, as she breathed through her ache, she realized:</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">Maybe it wasn‚Äôt love anymore.</span></p>
    <p><span class="highlight">Maybe it was just the memory of what love used to feel like.</span></p>
    <p>And that memory‚Ä¶ hurt more than the silence.</p>
