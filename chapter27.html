  <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 27:<br>March Memories & A Heart-Shaped Promise</h2>
  <p class="quote">"Some birthdays aren’t about getting older—they’re about growing deeper, together."</p>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>March had always meant something to <span class="highlight-text">Aavni</span>. It was the month of warmth, her birthday, and maybe now… something more.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>This year, things felt different. Softer. More real.<br><br>
    <span class="highlight-text">Darshan</span> texted her early that morning:<br>
    <em>Darshan: "Be ready by 4, bb. Wear something comfy but cute. I’m picking you up."</em><br>
    She smiled at the message, butterflies dancing in her stomach.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>By 4:05, his car was outside her house. He leaned out of the driver’s window, grinning in that way that still made her blush. She hopped in, heart already racing.<br>
    “Where are we going?” she asked, trying not to grin too much.<br>
    “You’ll see,” he said, eyes glinting with mischief. “Trust me.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>They drove beyond the city, past the chaos and traffic lights, into quiet stretches of road flanked by trees and sunset skies. The music in the car was soft—old romantic Hindi songs playing in the background.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>After about 40 minutes, she spotted it—sparkling under the setting sun. A lake. The water shimmered, and a gentle breeze kissed her cheeks.<br>
    “It’s beautiful,” she whispered.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>Darshan pulled over near the bank. “Wait till you see the full surprise.”<br>
    They got out of the car, hand in hand. He opened the backseat and pulled out a <span class="highlight-text">heart-shaped chocolate cake</span>—the one she always loved from their favorite bakery. Tucked beside it was a <span class="highlight-text">bouquet of fresh red roses</span>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>Her eyes widened. “Darshu… you did all this?”<br>
    He nodded. “Happy birthday, sunshine.”<br>
    Her lips trembled, emotions rushing over her. Before she could say anything, he went down on one knee, holding out a single red rose.<br>
    “Will you be mine—again and always?”<br>
    She laughed through her tears and nodded, hugging him tightly.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>They cut the cake, smeared chocolate on each other’s cheeks, and took endless selfies—cheek to cheek, goofy grins, kisses stolen between shots. The laughter came easy, the kind that felt like music.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>Eventually, the sun dipped lower, painting the sky with burnt orange and blush pink.<br>
    Back in the car, parked beside the lake, Aavni climbed into the backseat and tugged Darshan in with her. Their lips met softly, melting into each other like the last piece of chocolate cake.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>“I still can’t believe you remembered the exact cake,” she murmured against his lips.<br>
    “I remember everything about you,” he replied, brushing her hair back.<br>
    They kissed again—longer, deeper. His hand cupped her cheek as her fingers tangled in his shirt. Time slowed.<br>
    Outside, the breeze swayed the trees.<br>
    Inside, love wrapped around them like a blanket.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>As the playlist switched to their favorite track—“of Darshan Raval”—she laid her head on his shoulder.<br>
    “I wish this day never ended,” she whispered.<br>
    He kissed her forehead. “Then let’s keep making days like this.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>And so, they drove back with the windows slightly rolled down, hands locked over the gear, laughter echoing, hearts full.<br><br>
    <span class="highlight-text">Maybe love</span> wasn’t about grand gestures.<br>
    Maybe it was about lake sunsets, shared cake, soft music, and a boy who finally remembered to love her the way she deserved.</p>
