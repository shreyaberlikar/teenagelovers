    <h1>Chapter 9: After the Door Closed</h1>

    <h2>Part 1: Aavni’s Thoughts — Alone, but Glowing…</h2>
    <p>The door clicked shut behind him. She stood there for a moment—barefoot, her hair slightly messed up, the bedsheet still warm from where he’d held her.</p>
    <p>Silence. But not empty.</p>
    <p>Her heart was still racing, but slower now. Softer. Happier. The air in her room smelled faintly of his perfume… and chai. Her favorite mix now.</p>
    <p>She walked back to the mirror, touched her lips, smiled to herself, then hid her face in the pillow like a teenager who’d just kissed her crush for the first time.</p>
    <p class="highlight">“He didn’t just kiss me today. He knew exactly when to hold, when to pause, when to look into my eyes and ask without asking.”</p>
    <p>Her body still hummed with his touch. And her mind? A loop of everything he had said, from <span class="highlight">“You're trembling”</span> to <span class="highlight">“Your lips are sweeter than this tea.”</span></p>
    <p>She changed into her favorite pajamas and flopped back on the bed, hugging the pillow he had used.</p>
    <p class="highlight">“Was this love?” she whispered. “Or something even deeper?”</p>

    <h2>Part 2: Darshan’s POV — While Riding Away…</h2>
    <p>He rode slowly through their lane, a lazy smile stuck to his lips. Helmet on, but blush visible.</p>
    <div class="chat">
      <span><strong>Bro:</strong> Bola hota to party karaychi hoti. What happened?</span>
      <span><strong>Darshan:</strong> [no reply]</span>
    </div>
    <p>He didn’t reply. Because words felt too small right now.</p>
    <p>He remembered how her fingers tugged his t-shirt, how she gasped softly when he kissed her stomach. The way she giggled and said, <span class="highlight">“Bas kar, Darshu,”</span> while pouring chai.</p>
    <p>And when she kissed him goodbye at the door—just once, softly on the cheek—he knew that moment would live in his bones.</p>
    <p class="highlight">“She let me in,” he whispered. “And not just inside the gate.”</p>

    <h2>Part 3: The Next Morning — Teasing & Texting</h2>
    <div class="chat">
      <span><strong>🕖 8:44 a.m.</strong></span>
      <span><strong>Aavni:</strong> “You alive or in coma from last night?”</span>
      <span><strong>Darshan:</strong> “Alive. But deeply injured.”</span>
      <span><strong>Aavni:</strong> “Wtf 😳 HOW?”</span>
      <span><strong>Darshan:</strong> “Your kisses. Too powerful. Still recovering.”</span>
      <span><strong>Aavni:</strong> “Shut up, drama queen.”</span>
      <span><strong>Darshan:</strong> “I’m changing your contact name to ‘Mine’.”</span>
      <span><strong>Aavni:</strong> “Bro. NO.”</span>
      <span><strong>Darshan:</strong> “Too late. Also… that upper lip technique? 10/10. Tani ne sikhaya kya?”</span>
      <span><strong>Aavni:</strong> “SHUT UP! I’m blocking you!”</span>
      <span><strong>Darshan:</strong> “Cool. Block me. But you’ll miss me when you taste chai and it’s not my lips.”</span>
      <span><strong>Aavni:</strong> “…Okay fine. I kinda miss you already.”</span>
      <span><strong>Darshan:</strong> “Me too, bb. Let’s do this again. But next time, my turn to make chai.”</span>
      <span><strong>Aavni:</strong> “And what else will you serve with it, ha?”</span>
      <span><strong>Darshan:</strong> “Me. In your bed. Again.”</span>
    </div>
    <p>She stared at the screen, cheeks pink, grinning like an idiot. Hugged her phone to her chest and whispered,</p>
    <p class="highlight">“You’re trouble, Darshan. And I’m addicted.”</p>

    <p class="quote">“Some doors open to rooms…<br>Some open to entire galaxies.”</p>
