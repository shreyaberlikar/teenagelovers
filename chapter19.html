    <h1>Chapter 19: The Snap That Shattered</h1>

    <p>It was a cold, quiet evening in January 2024, one of those days that didn’t seem special—until it suddenly was.</p>
    <p>Aavni had come to meet Darshan at one of his friend’s flats. The air between them had been unusually light. Playful teases, soft kisses, stolen moments—everything felt just like it used to. She had let her guard down again. She always did when she was around him. That was her curse—her heart was too forgiving.</p>
    <p>They were curled up together, tangled in each other’s warmth. The room was dimly lit, soft music playing in the background. She had taken out her phone to snap a random picture—her messy hair, his fingers tracing her wrist lazily, a quiet kind of intimacy.</p>
    <p>Her phone battery flashed red. 2%. She sighed and reached over to grab Darshan’s phone, laughing, <span class="highlight">“Let me just click it from yours, my phone’s giving up.”</span></p>
    <p>He shrugged casually. <span class="highlight">“Go ahead.”</span></p>
    <p>He didn’t think she’d open Snapchat. But she did.</p>
    <p>And that’s when it changed.</p>
    <p>Her smile froze. In his Snapchat Best Friends list, there wasn’t one or two girls. It looked like half a girls’ hostel lived there. And these weren’t just random names. These were names she recognized. Girls he never told her about. People he swore he wasn’t close to.</p>
    <p>Typing. Saved messages. Red hearts. It hit her like cold water to the face.</p>
    <p>She didn’t speak. She didn’t yell. She simply placed his phone back on the table and stood up.</p>
    <p>He looked up, confused. <span class="highlight">“What happened?”</span></p>
    <p>She didn’t answer. Instead, she grabbed her bag and walked out, the night air hitting her face like a slap.</p>
    <p>Behind her, she heard the door creak. <span class="highlight">“Aavni! Oye, wait!”</span></p>
    <p>She didn’t.</p>
    <p>He followed her. <span class="highlight">“What did you see? Can you talk to me at least?”</span></p>
    <p>She turned, her voice trembling but calm. <span class="highlight">“I never checked your phone, Darshan. Never. You said you wanted space, I gave it. You wanted trust, I gave that too. But I guess you just needed freedom to betray it.”</span></p>
    <p><span class="highlight">“It’s not what it looks like,”</span> he said, the oldest line in the book.</p>
    <p>“Then what is it?” she asked. “Why are there so many girls in your private messages? Why don’t you ever talk to me about anything anymore?”</p>
    <p>He looked away.</p>
    <p>She continued, her voice cracking now. <span class="highlight">“I was never trying to control you, Darshan. I just wanted to feel included. I just wanted to feel like your person.”</span></p>
    <p>He stepped forward. “I didn’t mean to hide. It was just snaps. Nothing serious. I’m sorry, okay?”</p>
    <p>Her eyes welled up. “It’s not about the snaps. It’s about what they mean. It’s about the fact that I found out from your phone and not from you.”</p>
    <p>“I swear, I didn’t do anything with them,” he insisted.</p>
    <p>“That’s not the point!” she shouted, and then softened. “The point is... you don’t talk to me anymore. You don’t share. You don’t include me in your life.”</p>
    <p>They stood in silence for a moment. The sound of a passing rickshaw filled the gap between them.</p>
    <p>She looked away. “I’m not mad you talked to other girls. I’m hurt that I stopped being your favorite one.”</p>
    <p>He sighed, stepping back. “I’m sorry.”</p>
    <p>And then, like always, she blamed herself.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">Maybe I’m too emotional. Maybe I ask for too much. Maybe I’m not fun anymore.</span></p>
    <p>But deep down, she knew: trust, once cracked, never sounds the same again.</p>
