  <p class="quote">“They weren’t the same people—but the love never forgot their names.”</p>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>It had been years—yet some things hadn’t changed.<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">Darshan</span> still smiled like he held a thousand secrets behind his lashes, and <span class="highlight-text">Aavni</span> still looked at him like he was both the trouble and the cure.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>They weren’t the same teenagers anymore. Not entirely.<br>
    But somehow, sitting across from each other in that café, sipping chai with cold fingers intertwined, they felt like it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p><span class="highlight-text">“Do you remember our first ride to McD?”</span> <span class="highlight-text">Aavni</span> asked, grinning, her voice soft with nostalgia.<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">Darshan</span> laughed. <span class="highlight-text">“You spilled Coke all over the seat and blamed me.”</span><br>
    <span class="highlight-text">“Because it was your fault!”</span> she teased, flicking sugar at him.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>They broke into laughter—free, effortless, the kind that only lives between people who’ve seen each other break and still stayed.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <h4 class="highlight-text">A Love That Didn’t Expire</h4>
    <p>They had changed. Grown. Cried. Fought. Nearly walked away.<br>
    But the love? It had only deepened.</p>
    <p>Now, he didn’t just hold her hand during a movie. He held her when she cried after a tough exam.<br>
    She didn’t just wait for his calls. She called him out when he was wrong—and he listened.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p><span class="highlight-text">“I still fall in love with you every time you tie your hair like that,”</span> he whispered, brushing a strand from her cheek.<br>
    She looked away, biting her lip.<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">“And I still blush like an idiot when you say things like that,”</span> she whispered back.<br>
    They sat in silence, eyes doing the talking.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p><span class="highlight-text">“You know what scares me?”</span> he asked softly.<br>
    She tilted her head.<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">“That someday, this might not be enough for you.”</span><br>
    She took his hand, laced her fingers through his.<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">“Don’t be stupid, Darsh. You were my chaos. Now, you’re my calm.”</span></p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>That night, they sat on the hood of his car, under the sky that had seen every version of them—angry, wild, in love, broken, repaired.</p>
    <p>The stars above blinked quietly as he kissed her temple, and she rested her head on his shoulder.</p>
    <p>Their world had changed.<br>
    But their love? It hadn’t faded.<br>
    It had only learned to survive.</p>
