    <h1>Chapter 21: The Chance She Gave</h1>

    <p>Second chances aren’t for the weak—they're for the brave.<br>
    And Aavni was nothing if not brave.</p>

    <p>Even after everything—his lies, the indifference, the one-word replies, the ghosted calls—something in her heart whispered maybe this time, <span class="highlight">it'll be different</span>.</p>

    <div class="msg">“Let’s try again. One last time.”<br><strong>– Aavni</strong></div>
    <div class="msg">“I want that too.”<br><strong>– Darshan</strong></div>

    <p>And just like that, they were back. Not at the start—but somewhere in between <span class="highlight">heartbreak and hope</span>.</p>

    <p>Their first long drive after the break was on a dusky February evening. The breeze was cool, soft, and the sky blushed with hints of orange.</p>

    <p>Darshan looked over at her, grinning. “<span class="highlight">Missed this?</span>”<br>
    “<span class="highlight">More than you’ll ever know</span>,” she whispered.</p>

    <p>He even bought her roadside chai and told the chaiwala, “<span class="highlight">Don’t add too much sugar—she’s already too sweet.</span>”</p>

    <p>She laughed, cheeks glowing. It felt right again.</p>

    <p>He started replying faster. Calling her more often. Even sending good morning texts again.</p>

    <p>And for a moment, just a brief beautiful moment—<span class="highlight">Aavni believed</span>.</p>

    <p>But deep down, there were cracks. His smile didn’t always reach his eyes. His phone still faced down. And he never posted about her—even when she was capturing memories of them in every corner.</p>

    <p>Still, she waited. Waited for him to prove her wrong.</p>

    <p>One evening, after soft kisses in the car, she rested her head on his shoulder and whispered, “<span class="highlight">Thank you for choosing us again.</span>”</p>

    <p>He kissed her forehead and said... <strong>nothing</strong>.</p>

    <p>That silence told her everything. But still... she stayed.</p>

    <div class="quote">
      “She wasn’t holding on because she was weak.<br>
      She was holding on because letting go of someone you once saw your forever in—isn’t easy.”
