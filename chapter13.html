    <h1>Chapter 13: The Coffee Shop Apology</h1>

    <p>On <span class="highlight">November 19th, 2023</span>, the city air was cool, a little more forgiving than her emotions that day.</p>
    <p>Darshan had convinced her to meet, insisting they talk face-to-face ‚Äî promising it wouldn‚Äôt be dramatic, just a casual catch-up over coffee.</p>
    <p>Aavni agreed, heart guarded but slightly hopeful. The caf√© they chose was tucked into a quiet street, far from the usual chaos ‚Äî a place she once considered comforting.</p>
    <p>He was already there when she arrived, sitting at a window table, his hands nervously wrapped around a warm mug. His eyes lit up the moment he saw her.</p>
    <p>"<span class="highlight">Hey, cutie</span>," he smiled, trying to sound light, like nothing had happened.</p>
    <p>She didn‚Äôt smile back. Instead, she sat down, her arms folded across her chest. "Say what you have to say," she murmured.</p>
    <p>He exhaled, pretending to struggle for words. "I know I‚Äôve been distant. Cold. I just... get overwhelmed. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt love you. I miss you. Every day."</p>
    <p>She stared at him, her coffee untouched. "<span class="highlight">Then why do you vanish, Darshan?</span> Why do you make me feel like an option instead of a priority?"</p>
    <p>He leaned in. "Because I‚Äôm scared of how much you matter. I‚Äôm bad at this, Aavni. But I want to be better. For you."</p>
    <p>His words, smooth as ever, found their way past her logic. Again.</p>
    <p>She looked away, blinking back tears. "<span class="highlight">I hate that you always say the right things.</span>"</p>
    <p>"I mean them," he said softly. "You‚Äôre my sunshine, remember? How do I live without that?"</p>
    <p>She shook her head, trying not to melt.</p>
    <p>Minutes turned into an hour. Their conversations slowly drifted from pain to memories, then laughter. Somehow, the wall she had built crumbled brick by brick.</p>
    <p>Before they left, he reached out, gently holding her hand. "<span class="highlight">Let‚Äôs try again, baby. No games. Just us.</span>"</p>
    <p>And she ‚Äî still bruised, still unsure ‚Äî nodded. Because even broken hearts crave comfort.</p>
    <p>Outside the cafe, he pulled her into a soft hug. Her eyes closed as she let herself rest on his shoulder, wishing it could stay like this forever.</p>
    <p>But deep down, she knew... even <span class="highlight">sunshine can cast shadows.</span></p>
