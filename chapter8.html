    <h1>Chapter 8: When Nobody Was Watching</h1>

    <p>June. Aavni’s house.</p>

    <p>It was a late-June afternoon when the silence outside mirrored the storm brewing inside her chest. Aavni’s parents were out of town. The house stood quiet. So did her nerves.</p>

    <p>She glanced at her phone.<br>
    1 New Message — Darshan:<br>
    “I’m in front of your house. Come fast or I’ll shout ‘Aavni, I love you!’ from here.”</p>

    <p>She rushed to the gate, hands slightly trembling, barefoot, in an oversized tee and soft cotton shorts — nothing too obvious, yet not innocent either. Her heart thudded as she twisted the key and opened the gate.</p>

    <p>There he stood — leaning against his Activa, hair ruffled, wearing that grey tee she secretly loved. His eyes scanned her from head to toe and back, settling on her flustered smile.</p>

    <p>“You sure?” he asked, half teasing, half nervous.</p>

    <p>“Too late to ask,” she smirked, locking the gate behind him.</p>

    <p>Inside the house, the world fell away. No horns, no colony aunties, no calls. Just silence, four walls… and them.</p>

    <p>He sat on the sofa, pretending to be calm. She handed him water, her fingers brushing his. Electricity. She turned to walk away, but he held her wrist.</p>

    <p>“Wait,” he said softly. “Why are you nervous now?”</p>

    <p>“Because you’re here. And I know what that means,” she whispered.</p>

    <p>A pause. Then he stood. Inches away. One step forward, and their noses almost touched.</p>

    <p>“What does it mean?”<br>
    “It means I won’t be able to stop myself…”</p>

    <p><strong>Touches</strong></p>

    <p>He leaned in, cupped her face gently, and kissed her — soft at first. Just lips brushing, a test, a tease. Then again. Deeper. More urgent. His hands moved to her waist, her fingers sliding into his hair.</p>

    <p>“Wait,” she whispered. “I don’t want to rush…”<br>
    “We’re not,” he replied, forehead against hers. “We’re home.”</p>

    <p>He lifted her effortlessly, her legs wrapping around his waist instinctively. Their laughter slipped into breathless kisses as he carried her to the bedroom.</p>

    <p>He laid her gently on the bed like she was made of moonlight.<br>
    Kissed her forehead. Then her cheek. Then her neck. Down to her collarbone.</p>

    <p>“You smell like my favourite dream,” he murmured.</p>

    <p>Her hands tugged his tee off. His lips found her waist, her stomach, the soft curve of her hip.</p>

    <p>She gasped — not out of shock, but out of finally, finally feeling him that close.</p>

    <p>“You're trembling,” he whispered.<br>
    “I'm not scared,” she said. “I'm yours.”</p>

    <p>They kissed like they were drinking each other in. Like the world might vanish if they stopped. Every layer of cloth removed was like another wall falling between them.</p>

    <p>His fingers explored slowly — not greedy, but reverent. Her hands traced his back, his chest, memorizing. The room smelled of skin and whispered names and sighs that only two hearts could understand.</p>

    <p>Later, tangled in a messy bedsheet, her face resting on his chest, he played with her hair. They said nothing for minutes. Just soft giggles, breath syncing, hearts still racing.</p>

    <p>“You’re dangerous,” he whispered.<br>
    “You kissed me first,” she shot back.<br>
    He laughed. “Tani would be proud.”</p>

    <p>“She literally taught me how to kiss on hand and said: ‘Upper lip pe pehle jaana, bhul mat.’”</p>

    <p>“And did you?”<br>
    “You tell me,” she grinned.</p>

    <p>He kissed her again, slow and deep.</p>

    <p>They changed into comfy clothes. Aavni walked into the kitchen, still barefoot, and made chai. He watched her from the door, head tilted.</p>

    <p>“You know,” he said, “your lips are sweeter than this tea.”<br>
    She rolled her eyes, cheeks blushing. “Bas kar Darshu…”</p>

    <p><strong>The Panic & Goodbye</strong></p>

    <p>As the clock hit 6:45, panic crept back. She peeked out the curtain. No one in sight. Still…</p>

    <p>“You have to go,” she said, chest tight.<br>
    “I know. But I’ll be back.”</p>

    <p>He kissed her forehead. “Thank you for letting me in…”<br>
    “I don’t just mean the house,” he added.</p>

    <p>She hugged him tight before unlocking the gate.</p>

    <p>He vanished into the evening as quickly as he came, and Aavni stood there, barefoot, tea in hand, smiling to herself like a girl who had just lived her favorite chapter.</p>

    <em>“It wasn’t about crossing lines.<br>It was about knowing…<br>I trusted him enough to open the door.”</em>
