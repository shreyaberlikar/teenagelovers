    <h1>Chapter 5: Under the Stars, Just Us</h1>

    <p>🗓️ <strong>01/01/2025</strong><br>
    It was the first day of the new year — and Aavni was already teasing him over call.<br>
    “You think you know everything, huh?” she said with a flirty smirk in her voice.<br>
    “Meet me and I’ll show you what everything really means.”<br>
    Darshan chuckled. “When?”<br>
    “Now.”<br>
    Her voice was challenging, half-sweet, half-sassy — just the way he loved it.</p>

    <p>By 6 PM, the winter sky had faded into a deep navy. The cold settled in, but so did anticipation.<br>
    At 7, he was outside her gate — car headlights cutting through the fog.<br>
    She slid into the passenger seat with a soft “Hi, bb,” and leaned over to kiss his cheek.<br>
    “Wanna know my new year resolution?” she asked.<br>
    “What?”<br>
    “To ruin your mind. And then fix it with cuddles.”</p>

    <p>As they drove out of town, soft music played — their playlist.<br>
    Darshan’s hand kept brushing hers as he shifted gears, and each time he did, she smiled like it was the first time.<br>
    The silence was warm. Intimate. Like everything was understood without being said.<br>
    They reached their spot — tucked far from people and noise, surrounded by stars, trees, and secrets.</p>

    <p>Outside, they stood for a moment — cold air on their skin, eyes on the sky.<br>
    Inside, they knew what was about to happen.</p>

    <p>Back in the car — doors shut, world forgotten — time stopped existing.<br>
    Darshan looked at her and whispered,<br>
    <em>“You look like a dream tonight, sunshine.”</em><br>
    She leaned closer, her voice soft against his lips,<br>
    <em>“Then touch me like I’m not real…”</em><br>
    And he did.</p>

    <p>She climbed onto his lap slowly, wrapping her arms around his neck. Their lips met — deep, desperate, dizzying.<br>
    His hands slid under her hoodie, finding the bare warmth of her waist. Her gasp hit the air like music.<br>
    His name escaped her lips like a secret prayer: <strong>“Darshan…”</strong></p>

    <p>Her hoodie slipped off her shoulders. His lips trailed her neck, collarbone, the slope of her chest — leaving warm, wet kisses with each breath.<br>
    <em>“You’re so soft, cutie,”</em> he murmured, <em>“So perfect.”</em></p>

    <p>Her hands gripped his hair, tugging, needing more. He leaned back to look at her — cheeks flushed, pupils wide.<br>
    “Tell me what you want,” he asked, breath heavy.<br>
    <em>“You,”</em> she whispered. <em>“Every version of you. Every inch. Every sound.”</em></p>

    <p>Their bodies pressed closer, heat building as clothes disappeared — tossed in the backseat like petals of a flower too eager to bloom.<br>
    He kissed her chest, her stomach, her inner thighs — slow, reverent, addictively tender.<br>
    She arched under his touch, hands all over him — marking his back with her nails, breathing his name like poetry:<br>
    <em>“Darshan...… don’t stop.”</em></p>

    <p>He moved inside her slowly, carefully — watching her expression, memorizing her every sound.<br>
    She clung to him, moaning into his shoulder, whispering:<br>
    <em>“I love you in ways I can’t explain, and in places you can’t see.”</em><br>
    Their pace built. The windows fogged. The car moved gently with every rhythm.<br>
    <strong>Skin to skin… Soul to soul.</strong><br>
    “Don’t let this night end,” she whispered.<br>
    “I won’t,” he replied, kissing her deeply, “Not until you’re mine in every way.”</p>

    <p>And when they reached the edge — the moment where time collapsed and hearts exploded — they said nothing. Just breath. Just love. Just them.</p>

    <p>Later, she lay against him, sweaty, breathless, glowing.<br>
    He brushed her hair off her forehead and smiled,<br>
    <em>“Happy New Year, bb. You ruined me.”</em><br>
    She laughed, fingers tracing his jaw.<br>
    <em>“Good. Now you’re mine forever.”</em></p>

    <p>On the ride back, she recorded a mini vlog — lips swollen, cheeks pink.<br>
    The city lights came closer, but she didn’t want to leave the magic behind.<br>
    “You know,” he said quietly, “you once said you'd leave me in 2024…”<br>
    She turned to him, eyes full of something warm and unshakable.<br>
    <em>“Promise me something?”</em><br>
    “What, cutie?” he asked, squeezing her hand.<br>
    <em>“Promise you’ll never let me go.”</em><br>
    He looked at her with that intense gaze — the one that undressed everything but her clothes.<br>
    <em>“I promise. But only if you stay mine too.”</em><br>
    “I always was.”</p>

    <p>At the gate, before she stepped out, she kissed him again. Soft. Long. Final.<br>
    Then she whispered, <strong>“Thank you for making the first day of 2025 unforgettable, Darsh.”</strong><br>
    He smiled. <em>“Here’s to every day after, Aav.”</em><br>
    And the stars watched them fade into their own kind of forever. 💌💌💌</p>
