  <h1>Chapter 7: Confessions, Cadburys & The Chaos of Love</h1>

  <p><em>(aka when love started tasting like chocolate and touching like electricity)</em></p>

  <p><strong>From January 23, 2022 onwards:</strong><br>“I loved you then. I love you still.”<br>
  Aavni didn’t blink. Didn’t breathe. The text just sat there on her screen like a mini heart attack.<br>
  And the worst part? She smiled.</p>

  <p>“What if I feel it now?”<br>She couldn’t believe she sent that. Tani, her roomie and chaos partner, literally screamed from the bed next to her.<br>
  “YOU WHAT?! Girl, you just drop emotional nukes like that?”<br>
  “I dunno,” Aavni whispered. “It just… slipped.”</p>

  <p>Darshan replied.<br>“Then I love you even more now.”<br>
  She swore her lungs stopped working. Screaming into pillows. K-drama vibes. Real love? Maybe.</p>

  <p><strong>February 12 – Chocolate Day Madness 🍫</strong><br>
  Darshan messaged: “I’ll come on bike. Just five mins. I have something sweet for someone sweeter.”<br>
  She rolled her eyes, grabbed a Dairy Milk for him. At 5:37 PM sharp, he showed up—black shirt, Silk bar, rom-com vibes.</p>

  <p>“For the girl who’s now officially mine.”<br>
  She giggled, gave him the Dairy Milk, and then—vroooom. Gone.<br>
  “Was that a date or a drive-thru?” she texted.<br>
  “Your face looked like dessert,” he replied.</p>

  <p><strong>March 9 – Shy Bridge, Shy Kids 🌉</strong><br>
  First meet after confession. Nervous smiles. Hoodie hugs in spirit. They stood, laughed, teased. Nothing touched. But everything felt.<br>
  Their eyes said what their mouths didn’t.</p>

  <p><strong>March 10 – Birthday, Baby! 🎁</strong><br>
  Her day. Her sparkle. Her magic.<br>
  He brought a small box: couple rings. Not gold. Not fancy. But them.<br>
  “For the girl who changed my year.”<br>
  They wore them. No kisses. Just warmth. Just love.</p>

  <p><strong>March 16 – First Hug & Tani’s Wild Tips</strong><br>
  Tani’s dramatic advice on hugging and kissing was… chaotic.<br>
  “We don’t do awkward smudged lip kisses in this house!”<br>
  Aavni laughed. Panicked. Prepared?</p>

  <p>Later that day…<br>
  He said, “C’mere.”<br>
  She slid into his arms. His hands on her back. Her heart: blender mode.<br>
  Her first hug — and it felt like flying.</p>

  <p><strong>March 22 – Kiss Me, Not There</strong><br>
  He whispered, “Kiss me.”<br>
  She kissed his cheek.<br>
  “Not there.”<br>
  She panicked. Then… did it.<br>
  Slow. Soft. Real. Right.<br>
  Upper lip. Lower lip. Hoodie. Hands. Magic.<br>
  <em>(PS: Tani’s hand-kiss advice? Worked. But don’t tell her.)</em></p>

  <p>From Dairy Milks to couple rings, awkward silences to electric kisses —<br>
  they weren’t just falling.<br>
  They were diving.<br>
  Building their own universe of little firsts. 💗</p>
