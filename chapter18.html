    <h1>Chapter 18: Holding On in Pieces</h1>
    <p>Days passed, each one heavy in <span class="highlight">Aavni's chest</span>.</p>
    <p>The air between her and Darshan had shifted. It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t violent. But it was breaking her slowly—like a <span class="highlight">silent heartbreak</span> that echoed every time she laughed with her friends and wished he was part of that moment too.</p>
    <p>She was hurting—emotionally, quietly, completely.</p>
    <p>But still, she held on.</p>
    <p>Every time he texted, no matter how dry or delayed, her heart flipped. Every time his name lit up on her phone, she smiled, even when she’d just wiped tears away.</p>
    <p>There was a certain kind of madness in teenage love—a belief that if you just keep trying harder, holding tighter, things would magically go back to how they used to be.</p>
    <p>This was the age of firsts. <span class="highlight">First butterflies. First 3 a.m. calls. First I love you. First fights. First heartbreaks.</span> And sometimes, first disappointments that lingered longer than they should.</p>
    <p>Aavni wasn't perfect either. She had her mood swings, her insecurities, and the weight of <span class="highlight">PCOS</span> on her health and mind. But what she gave him was real—every effort, every hug, every silent prayer that he’d love her a little better, hold her a little tighter.</p>
    <p>She remembered the way she used to tell her friends, “It’s okay, maybe he’s tired,” or “He’s not good with emotions,” just to protect his image in front of everyone, even when it meant hiding her hurt.</p>
    <p>Because sometimes, that’s how teenage love works.</p>
    <p>You romanticize pain. You forgive too easily. You blame yourself too often. You convince your heart that <span class="highlight">bare minimum is still love</span> because it used to be enough before. And in that chaos, you lose parts of yourself that you didn’t even know were fading.</p>
    <p>Aavni wasn’t just loving him. <span class="highlight">She was surviving him.</span></p>
    <p>And yet, she didn’t leave.</p>
    <p>Because the teenage heart is foolishly brave—it dreams in sparkles and heals in silence.</p>
    <p>She'd spend nights replaying their old messages, photos, audios, and the way he once called her "cutie," the way he promised to never leave. Maybe she still believed some of those words. Maybe she was just scared of starting over. Or maybe—deep down—she still saw a flicker of that boy who once stood outside her house just to get a glimpse of her.</p>
    <blockquote>
      "Not all love stories are fairytales. Some are battlefields where one fights while the other just watches."
    </blockquote>
    <p>But she wasn’t done fighting. Not yet.</p>
