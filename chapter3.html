    <p>The weight of exams pressed heavily on Aavni. Each page of her notes seemed to blur into the next. Out of frustration‚Äîand half in jest‚Äîshe called Darshan the night before.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">‚ÄúCome meet me, or I‚Äôll lose my mind!‚Äù</span> she‚Äôd exclaimed, expecting his usual playful response.</p>

    <p>But his calm reply, <span class="highlight">‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming tomorrow,‚Äù</span> left her stunned.</p>

    <p>By morning, Darshan had already arrived in her city ‚Äî staying at a friend‚Äôs flat. <span class="romantic">For her‚Ä¶</span></p>

    <p>At 10 a.m., his call came. She was still wrapped in sleep. <span class="highlight">‚ÄúI‚Äôm here,‚Äù</span> he said simply.</p>

    <p>Torn between excitement and responsibility, she promised him they‚Äôd meet later that evening. By 2 p.m., she took a break and called him. Within minutes, he arrived ‚Äî wearing a yellow shirt that seemed to glow.</p>

    <p>They sat together, fingers intertwined, <span class="romantic">laughter dancing with the soft patter of rain.</span> When the rain thickened, he gently insisted she return to her books.</p>

    <p>By 7 p.m., she couldn‚Äôt wait. She took the metro and they rode through the city ‚Äî <span class="romantic">her arms wrapped around his waist, the night alive around them.</span> Eventually, they reached his friend‚Äôs flat.</p>

    <p>The room was dim with fairy lights. <span class="romantic">Their kiss was deep, urgent ‚Äî every touch echoing months of quiet yearning. He held her like poetry.</span> Later, tangled in warmth, they shared food and kisses, laughter and silence.</p>

    <p>She woke early, studying quietly beside him, stealing kisses. At 9:45, he dropped her at the exam center. He left. She cried ‚Äî but she knew. <span class="romantic">This was love. The real kind.</span></p>

    <p>In the midst of chaos, <span class="romantic">he was the calm. When he was around, the world faded away‚Ä¶</span></p>
