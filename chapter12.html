    <p>One call. One voice trembling through tears.</p>
    <p>Aavni dialed his number, her breath shaky, frustration wrapped around every word.</p>
    <p>‚Äú<span class="highlight">Why haven't you changed, Darshan?</span> Why does it always feel like I care too much and you care too little?‚Äù</p>
    <p>He stayed quiet for a moment, then sighed. ‚ÄúAavni... you always think the worst of me. It‚Äôs not like that. I do care.‚Äù</p>
    <p>But his words felt too polished, too practiced.</p>
    <p>She could feel herself breaking all over again. Not from what he said, but from how familiar this was. The same pattern. The same excuses. And somehow, the same pull.</p>
    <p>‚ÄúYou only come back when you feel like it,‚Äù she whispered, voice cracking. ‚ÄúAnd I always let you.‚Äù</p>
    <p>He sighed again, a sound that made her chest tighten. ‚Äú<span class="highlight">Don‚Äôt cry, sunshine</span>. You're too strong for that. Maybe I messed up... but can we not fight today? Just talk, like we used to?‚Äù</p>
    <p>She hesitated. Logic told her to hang up. Her heart said otherwise.</p>
    <p>Teja and Tani had warned her, again and again. They‚Äôd seen her tears, her silence, her irritability. They saw what she tried to hide behind fake smiles and half-hearted jokes.</p>
    <p>But in that moment, all she wanted was to feel something familiar.</p>
    <p>‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut this doesn‚Äôt change anything.‚Äù</p>
    <p>‚ÄúOf course not,‚Äù he replied. But she could hear the smirk in his voice.</p>
    <p>Aavni closed her eyes. She knew better.</p>
    <p>But sometimes, <span class="highlight">knowing better doesn‚Äôt mean doing better</span>.</p>

    <p class="quote">‚ÄúShe wasn‚Äôt weak for giving chances. <br>
    She was strong for hoping he‚Äôd finally be the version of himself she fell for.‚Äù</p>
