    <div class="narration">It was a quiet night in May. 11:23 PM. Casual texting. But something didn‚Äôt feel right.</div>

    <div class="whatsapp-msg sent">Hey, btw... where‚Äôs the shirt I gave you for your birthday?</div>
    <div class="whatsapp-msg received">In my cupboard. Haven‚Äôt worn it yet.</div>

    <div class="narration">She felt it. A lie. Instinct more than proof.</div>

    <div class="whatsapp-msg sent">Which cupboard? Show me?</div>
    <div class="whatsapp-msg received">Why? It‚Äôs just there.</div>
    <div class="whatsapp-msg sent">I wanna see you in it. Now. Send a pic.</div>

    <div class="narration">There was a pause. A long one.</div>

    <div class="whatsapp-msg received">I... actually can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs kind of not here right now.</div>
    <div class="whatsapp-msg sent">Not here?</div>
    <div class="whatsapp-msg received">I gave it to someone.</div>
    <div class="whatsapp-msg sent">Who?</div>
    <div class="whatsapp-msg received">Yash.</div>

    <div class="narration">She didn‚Äôt respond immediately. Her chest tightened.</div>

    <div class="whatsapp-msg sent">You gave your birthday gift to your best friend?</div>
    <div class="whatsapp-msg received">I‚Äôm sorry. It was a bit long for me and... he liked it. I didn‚Äôt think it would matter.</div>

    <div class="narration">But it did. It mattered more than she could explain.</div>

    <div class="whatsapp-msg sent">You didn‚Äôt think it would matter because I never mattered to you.</div>
    <div class="whatsapp-msg received">Don‚Äôt say that. Please. I didn‚Äôt mean to hurt you.</div>
    <div class="whatsapp-msg sent">You could‚Äôve told me. I would‚Äôve laughed it off maybe. But you lied. Lied for weeks.</div>
    <div class="whatsapp-msg received">I didn‚Äôt want to upset you.</div>
    <div class="whatsapp-msg sent">So you chose to deceive me instead?</div>

    <div class="divider">‚ãØ</div>

    <div class="narration">She shut the chat, turned off her phone, and curled into a ball. The shirt was just cotton. But her love... it was stitched all over it. And now it was worn by someone else.</div>

    <div class="quote">‚ÄúHe gave away her love like it was nothing.<br>And yet she stayed, wondering if maybe next time‚Ä¶ he'd keep it.‚Äù</div>
