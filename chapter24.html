  <p class="quote">“Sometimes, it’s not the cheating that breaks you… it’s the fact that you believed in them so much, you never thought they could.”

  <div class="message-block">
    <p><span class="highlight-text">Aavni’s</span> hands trembled around her phone. Her vision was blurred, not from the cold January night—but from the storm raging inside her.<br>
    She had called him once. Twice. Three times. No answer.<br><br>
    “He’s sleeping,” she thought bitterly.<br>
    She stepped outside, one thought echoing: <span class="highlight-text">I need answers.</span><br>
    Each step felt heavier. Her breath shallow, chest tight. Tears pressed at her eyes—but she swallowed them.<br><br>
    She called again. This time, he picked up.<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">“Come outside.”</span><br>
    Darshan sounded half-asleep. <span class="highlight-text">“What happened…?”</span><br><br>
    He saw her from the gate. She thrust her phone at him.<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">“Read it.”</span>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>On the screen—<span class="highlight-text">messages from Anjali</span>.<br>
    His expression crumbled. His phone slipped, crashing to the pavement.<br><br>
    <span class="highlight-text">“I trusted you!”</span> she screamed. “You were my world, Darshan. And you were someone else’s too?”<br>
    She cried harder than ever. Her entire body shook. <br><br>
    Rohan rushed over, “Guys, please, not here. Darshan... say something!”<br>
    But Aavni couldn’t contain it—<span class="highlight-text">SLAP.</span><br>
    “Why did you do this to me?” she sobbed.<br>
    Rohan held her, “Aavni, listen. Let him explain once.”<br>
    She nodded faintly.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>They met again. Just the two of them.<br>
    Darshan stood silently.<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">“Mazya madhye kay kami hota?”</span> she asked. “What was I not enough in, Darshan?”<br><br>
    He stepped forward, eyes glistening. “You were enough. Always more than enough.”<br>
    “Then why?”<br>
    “She texted first. It happened... I swear, barely a month. I stopped replying.”<br><br>
    “She said she’d harm herself. Cut her veins. She blackmailed me.”<br>
    “You could’ve told me,” Aavni muttered. “You lied instead.”<br>
    “I didn’t want to lose you. I showed her our chats. Told her I had someone.”<br>
    “But I lost trust,” she said, “You broke it with your silence.”<br>
    “I love you,” he whispered. “Please, don’t leave me like this.”
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>They stood there, hearts bruised. She stepped forward—<br>
    Hugged him. Tight.<br><br>
    But even wrapped in his arms… <span class="highlight-text">she didn’t feel peace.</span><br>
    Only pain. Only confusion.<br>
    A love too scarred to feel whole again.
