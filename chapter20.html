    <h1>Chapter 20: When Two Hearts Break Together</h1>

    <p>The room was dim, lit only by the faint yellow glow of fairy lights coiled around the curtain rod. Aavni sat cross-legged on her bed, her phone face-down beside her, heart clenched tight, thoughts louder than the silence in the room.</p>

    <p>A knock echoed. She opened the door to see <span class="highlight">Teja</span>, her best friend, standing there, arms folded around a small overnight bag.</p>

    <p><span class="chat">“Raj cheated,”</span> Teja said bluntly, her voice raw and cracked with disbelief.</p>

    <p>Aavni didn’t say a word. She pulled Teja into a hug, and for a few seconds, neither of them had to be strong. Two girls, each betrayed by the one they trusted the most.</p>

    <p>They changed into pajamas and settled onto the bed, legs tangled in a blanket, fingers curled around warm mugs of coffee. The air between them was thick with unspoken truths.</p>

    <p>Teja broke the quiet first. <span class="chat">“It hurts when you’ve done everything right… and still get left behind.”</span></p>

    <p>Aavni swallowed hard. <span class="chat">“I was just thinking the same thing.”</span></p>

    <p>She thought of Darshan—his laugh, his touch, the way his eyes once searched hers. And then she thought of how those same eyes could lie so easily. Of the Snapchat discovery. Of how she had walked out in tears, and how he had followed her—not to fix it, but to protect his own image.</p>

    <p>She unlocked her phone and stared at the screen. She didn’t want revenge. Or anger. Just… peace.</p>

    <p>With a steady hand, she typed:</p>
    <p class="chat">I think we need a break, Darshan. This isn’t healthy anymore, and I don’t feel loved. Not the way I should be.</p>

    <p>It took him 8 minutes to reply.</p>
    <p class="chat">Okay. If that’s what you want.</p>

    <p>That was it. No fight. No apology. No question. No <span class="highlight">“can we talk?”</span></p>

    <p>Aavni stared at the screen, her lips parting slightly in disbelief. Maybe a part of her had still hoped he would beg her to stay.</p>

    <p>But he didn’t. And that, somehow, hurt the most.</p>

    <p>Teja noticed the shift in her eyes. <span class="chat">“What did he say?”</span></p>

    <p>Aavni shook her head with a hollow smile. <span class="chat">“Nothing. Just… okay.”</span></p>

    <p>Teja exhaled deeply. <span class="chat">“Then maybe that’s your answer.”</span></p>

    <p>Later that night, while Teja was asleep beside her, Aavni lay wide awake, replaying everything.</p>

    <p>This wasn’t the dramatic breakup scene she imagined. It was quiet. Cold. Emotionless.</p>

    <p>But maybe that’s exactly what she needed.</p>

    <p>Her last text had finally freed her—from the endless waiting, overthinking, doubting.</p>

    <p>She placed her phone face-down again. Not for him this time. But for herself.</p>

    <p>And as she drifted off to sleep, she whispered, barely audible even to herself, <span class="highlight">“I loved you more than you’ll ever know.”</span></p>

    <p>But that was yesterday.</p>

    <p class="quote">“Not all breakups are loud. Some end in silence—and heal in the quiet that follows.”</p>
