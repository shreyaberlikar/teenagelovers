    <h1>Chapter 6: A Love Story Rekindled</h1>

    <p>Aavni sat curled on Darshan’s lap, arms draped around his neck, her laughter spilling freely into the soft silence of the room. His fingertips traced circles on her back as he kissed her temple gently.</p>

    <p><em>“You’re literally made to fit here,”</em> he whispered against her skin. <em>“In my arms. Where you’ve always belonged.”</em></p>

    <p>She smirked, nudging him. <em>“Charmer. Do you remember how we met?”</em></p>

    <p>“How could I forget?” He tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. “You were this loud, bossy little girl who refused to share her crayons.”</p>

    <p><em>“Excuse me, I was adorable.”</em></p>

    <p>“No lies there, cutie. You still are.”</p>

    <p>They had known each other since they were five. Same town. Same school. Same benches. From sharing tiffins to fighting over pencils — their bond was unbreakable. But life, as cruelly sweet as it is, pulled them apart after 8th grade. Different campuses. Different routines. And eventually… silence.</p>

    <p>But then came tenth grade — and a string of messages from a certain mechanical boy with a stubborn heart.</p>

    <p><strong>“I used to find you so annoying,”</strong> Aavni chuckled.<br>
    <strong>“And yet,”</strong> he teased, <strong>“you replied every single time.”</strong></p>

    <p>She blushed. <em>“I guess somewhere deep down… I missed you.”</em></p>

    <p><strong>February 2021 – The Midnight Confession</strong><br>
    That one night changed everything.</p>

    <p><strong>Darshan:</strong> “I need to tell you something.”<br>
    <strong>Aavni:</strong> “What?”<br>
    <strong>Darshan:</strong> “I love you.”</p>

    <p>Three words. Typed. Sent… And just like that — a silence louder than thunder.</p>

    <p><strong>Aavni:</strong> “I’m sorry… I don’t feel the same.”</p>

    <p>He took it quietly.<br>
    <strong>Darshan:</strong> “It’s okay. I just… needed you to know.”</p>

    <p>He never brought it up again. Never pressured. Never left. He stayed — like the most patient kind of love. The kind that waited in silence but never gave up.</p>

    <p><strong>One Year Later…</strong><br>
    Aavni cycled past him one afternoon. He was on his bike, hoodie on, headphones in. But their eyes met — and something fluttered in her chest. Something… real.</p>

    <p>Soon after, she found herself texting him again. But this time, she was the one starting it. This time, she couldn’t stay away.</p>

    <p><strong>January 23, 2022 – The Twist</strong><br>
    <strong>Aavni:</strong> “Do you have a girlfriend?”<br>
    <strong>Darshan:</strong> “Nope.”<br>
    <strong>Aavni:</strong> “Still love the girl you confessed to?”<br>
    <strong>Darshan:</strong> “Always have. But she never loved me back.”<br>
    <strong>Aavni:</strong> “What if she does now?”<br>
    <strong>Darshan:</strong> “Are you serious?”<br>
    <strong>Aavni:</strong> “Maybe…”<br>
    <strong>Darshan:</strong> “Then maybe I love her even more now.”</p>

    <p><em>“And in that moment,”</em> she would later write in her diary, <em>“I realized… the boy I’d once turned away was the only one I ever wanted to run toward.”</em></p>

    <p><strong>Back in the present…</strong><br>
    Aavni blinked, realizing she had drifted into the past. Darshan was watching her — those chocolate-brown eyes laced with mischief.</p>

    <p><em>“You were lost in thoughts again, weren’t you?”</em><br>
    “Hmm.” She bit her lip. <em>“I was thinking about us.”</em><br>
    Darshan pulled her even closer, her legs now completely tangled around his waist.<br>
    <em>“You know what drives me crazy?”</em> he whispered against her neck.<br>
    <em>“The way you still blush when I call you mine.”</em></p>

    <p><em>“Stop…”</em> she said, half-laughing.<br>
    <em>“Never,”</em> he replied. <em>“You’re my bb, my soft chaos, my forever caffeine.”</em></p>

    <p>She leaned in, forehead to his.<br>
    <strong>“I love you, Darshan.”</strong><br>
    <em>“I loved you even when I wasn’t allowed to,”</em> he whispered.<br>
    <em>“And now that I can… I’ll love you louder.”</em></p>

    <p>Their kiss that followed was not rushed — but deep. Soft. Soaked in all the years they spent unknowingly falling for each other.</p>

    <p>Her hands found his jaw.<br>
    His lips found her soul.<br>
    And between that kiss and the quiet…<br>
    their story came full circle.</p>

    <p><em>From crayons and benches…<br>
    To lips and promises.<br>
    From best friends…<br>
    To the love story they never saw coming.</em></p>

    <p><strong>“I loved her quietly for years — until she turned around and whispered… ‘What if I love you now?’”</strong></p>
