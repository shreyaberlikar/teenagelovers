  <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 23:<br>The Girl Behind the Blocklist</h2>
  <p class="quote">"It wasn’t the betrayal that broke her. It was the fact that she stayed after every red flag, thinking love would be enough."</p>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p><span class="highlight-text">August 12, 2023.</span> Aavni would never forget that date.<br><br>
    A few days before, Darshan had casually asked, <span class="highlight-text">"Hey, give me your Insta ID and password?"</span><br>
    She didn't even think twice.<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">"Why not?"</span> she thought. <span class="highlight-text">"Trust is everything."</span><br>
    She typed out the credentials and sent them without hesitation. No questions. No doubts.<br><br>
    Two days later, she noticed something strange. A girl named <span class="highlight-text">Anjali</span> had been blocked. She hadn't blocked anyone.<br>
    Curious, she asked him, <span class="highlight-text">"Darsh... who’s Anjali? Why is she blocked from my account?"</span><br>
    His reply came instantly:<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">Darshan:</span> "She’s a relative... kind of. She stalks me a lot. I don’t want her knowing about us. She might tell my family things."
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>Something about the tone felt off. But Aavni didn’t press further. She simply replied:<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">Aavni:</span> "Okay. I trust you."
    </p>

    <p>But the thought lingered.<br>
    So, two days later, she quietly unblocked Anjali... and sent her a follow request.<br>
    Anjali accepted.<br><br>
    At <span class="highlight-text">6:42 PM</span>, her phone buzzed with a message request:
    </p>
    <p><span class="highlight-text">Anjali:</span> “Hey. Are you Darshan’s girlfriend?”<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">Aavni:</span> “Yes, and I always will be.”</p>

    <p>A pause. Then came the message that made her breath catch.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight-text">Anjali:</span> “I was his girlfriend too.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p><span class="highlight-text">Aavni’s</span> hands trembled. She typed:<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">Aavni:</span> “What do you mean?”<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">Anjali:</span> “I was with him for the past few months. I didn’t know about you until recently.”<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">Aavni:</span> “Since when?”<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">Anjali:</span> “March. We met through mutual friends. We met often... we kissed... we’ve been close.”<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">Aavni:</span> “Are you serious?”<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">Anjali:</span> “Yes. He told me I was the only one.”</p>
    <p>Then she sent a photo—<span class="highlight-text">cuts on her wrist</span>.<br>
    Tears blurred Aavni’s vision. Her heart cracked in places she didn’t know existed.
    </p>
    <p><span class="highlight-text">Anjali:</span> “I wish none of this happened. I really liked him.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>Aavni sat back, shattered. She had trusted him with every part of her soul. And now—<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">She blamed herself.</span><br>
    Maybe I was too emotional. Too possessive. Too much.<br>
    But she wasn’t.<br>
    She was just a girl in love—with a boy who didn’t deserve her.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>Her fingers hovered over his chat.<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">Aavni:</span><br>
    “You gave the gift I gave you... to your friend.<br>
    You blocked a girl on my account, and lied about her being a relative.<br>
    And now I find out… she was your girlfriend too?<br>
    I trusted you. But you were never mine to trust.”</p>
