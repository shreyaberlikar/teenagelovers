  <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 25:<br>Darshan’s POV: Guilt Is Loud at 2 A.M.</h2>
  <p class="quote">“He made mistakes. Terrible ones. But his love wasn’t a lie—just deeply flawed, and too afraid to lose what it couldn’t replace.”</p>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>The streetlight buzzed softly outside. <span class="highlight-text">Darshan</span> sat on Yash’s bedroom floor, phone blank beside him. <br>
    <span class="highlight-text">“I messed up, bro,”</span> Darshan whispered.<br><br>
    “She wasn’t just any girl. <span class="highlight-text">Aavni</span>… she was home.”<br>
    “She trusted me with everything. And what did I do? Lied. Took her love for granted.”<br><br>
    Yash leaned forward. “You love her, right?”<br>
    “More than anyone,” Darshan said. “But I… I broke her.”<br><br>
    “She hugged me after everything. Still hoping I’d be the guy she believed in.”<br>
    “I didn’t cheat with my heart. But I betrayed her trust.”<br>
    “I should’ve been honest from the start.”<br>
    “I don’t even know who I was trying to protect—her or myself.”
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>Yash sighed. “Then fix it, idiot. Earn her back. Be the guy she fell for.”<br>
    Darshan nodded. “I’ll do anything. I just hope… <span class="highlight-text">it’s not too late.</span>”</p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="chapter-title">The Second Chance</h2>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>The night had swallowed her. Tears dried—but her heart still bled.<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">She should’ve walked away.</span><br>
    But she didn’t.<br><br>
    She remembered <span class="highlight-text">Teja</span>. How even she gave a second chance.<br>
    Not because she was weak, but because love makes you brave.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>That morning, hands trembling, she typed:<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">Aavni: Let’s try. But don’t make me regret it, Darshan.</span><br><br>
    His reply came fast:<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">Darshan: I promise. I swear—I won’t lose you again.</span><br>
    A part of her wanted to believe. Another warned her.<br>
    But she silenced doubt—for now.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>No grand gestures. Just emotion-laced silence.<br>
    He held her hand gently.<br>
    <span class="highlight-text">“I’ll never lie again, Aavni.”</span><br>
    She nodded—but stayed silent. He had to earn it all back.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-block">
    <p>In the weeks that followed:<br>
    Long drives. Midnight calls. Laughter. <br>
    But the innocence was gone.<br><br>
    What remained was <span class="highlight-text">love tested by fire.</span><br>
    Burnt—but not destroyed. <br>
    And that made it stronger.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="quote">“She didn’t take him back because she forgot. She took him back because she remembered everything… and still hoped love could win.”</p>
