    <h1>Chapter 11: The Red Flags in the Air</h1>

    <p>Everything looked perfect from the outside. Aavni and Darshan were the textbook example of young love‚Äîcalls that stretched till midnight, sweet dates in hidden caf√©s, and hand-written notes folded into coat pockets. But somewhere between the warm chai and soft kisses, cracks had begun to form.</p>

    <p>Since June, something had changed. The messages that once came with a "good morning, bb" had reduced to one dry "hey" every 3-4 days. Calls became rare, and meetings? One in four months, if lucky. She tried brushing it off, thinking maybe he was busy or tired. But deep inside, something ached‚Äîa cold space where warmth used to live.</p>

    <p>She didn‚Äôt say much at first. But her face did. The spark that once made her glow when his name popped up was now replaced by a sigh. Her phone barely lit up now. When it did, it was from friends asking, "Are you okay?"</p>

    <p>Aavni wasn't okay.</p>

    <div class="divider">‚ãÜ ÀöÔΩ°‚ãÜ‡≠® Lunch Break Meltdown ‡≠ß‚ãÜÔΩ°Àö ‚ãÜ</div>

    <p>It was a regular noon. The classroom was noisy. Girls surrounded one another, passing dabbas, chewing over gossip, while a group of four friends in the back corner had pulled out chits for their daily round of Truth & Dare.</p>

    <p>Tana, Teja, Aavni, and two others sat nearby, giggling occasionally. The dares were absurd. Laughter filled the room. But Aavni wasn‚Äôt part of it.</p>

    <p>She was blankly staring at her phone screen. No messages. No missed calls. Just the wallpaper of Darshan holding her hand from months ago.</p>

    <p>"<strong>Kiti vela baghte hai phone? Yetoy ka message?</strong>" Teja said, keeping her voice low.</p>

    <p>"<strong>Nahi re... Kalun 3 divas zhale, ek message pan nahi. Ani story pan taktoy masti kartoy,</strong>" Aavni said, voice cracked but trying to laugh it off.</p>

    <p>"<strong>Sod na, Aavnu. If he wanted to, he would. Ani tu... tu tar sagli detes tyachya sathi,</strong>" said Tana, eyes sharp.</p>

    <p>"<strong>Mi nahi karu shakat ata... Sagla mi karto. Mi call karto, mi plan karte...</strong>" Her voice broke mid-sentence.</p>

    <div class="divider">‚ú¶ ‚ùò Breaking Point ‚ùò ‚ú¶</div>

    <p>Later, the girls moved to the canteen. Aavni sat between them, head down. She was usually the loudest, the one teasing others, the one making jokes. But today she looked... small.</p>

    <p>"Mi tired aahe," she said quietly.</p>

    <p>"Of him or of yourself?" Tana asked. Silence.</p>

    <blockquote>
      "You break your own heart." ‚Äì Teja
    </blockquote>

    <p>She nodded, remembering the many evenings she stood by her window, eyes on his house across the street, hoping he‚Äôd call, step out, or even just wave. He never did.</p>

    <div class="divider">‚úß ‚úß ‚úß</div>

    <p>One evening, she typed a long message:<br>
      <em>"Why are we like this now? Why am I the only one showing up? I love you... but I‚Äôm tired."</em></p>

    <p>She didn‚Äôt send it.</p>

    <div class="divider">‚úß Sass Queens üíÖ</div>

    <p><strong>Tana:</strong> He treats her like an option.<br>
       <strong>Teja:</strong> And she makes him her priority.<br>
       <strong>Aavni:</strong> Maybe I‚Äôm just sensitive... my PCOS, my health...<br>
       <strong>Tana:</strong> Don‚Äôt justify his negligence with your pain.<br>
       <strong>Teja:</strong> Love is not pain, Aavnu. He should be your peace, not the reason you cry during recess.</p>

    <div class="divider">‚ãÜ‡º∂‚ãÜ Whisper of Strength ‚ãÜ‡º∂‚ãÜ</div>

    <p>That night, Aavni stood by the window and looked at Darshan‚Äôs house. The light in his room was on.</p>

    <p>She didn‚Äôt cry this time. She smiled sadly and whispered, <em>‚ÄúI miss you, Darshu. But I miss myself more.‚Äù</em></p>

    <blockquote>
      "You don't lose people when you walk away. You find yourself again."
